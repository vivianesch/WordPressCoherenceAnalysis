# Exploratory analyses for understand how Core WordPress Community coproduce code
# General Question: Wich are the atributes of coproduction (colunms of dataframe or variables)?
# Which type of developers groups exist in WC?
# It is possible to make some indicator from this data?

# Data come from https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&col=version&col=severity&col=resolution&col=time&col=changetime&col=focuses&col=reporter&col=keywords&order=priority
